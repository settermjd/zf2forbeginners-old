# Zend Framework 2 For Beginners

## Introduction

The aim of this repository is to support the upcoming book, [Zend Framework 2 for Beginners](https://leanpub.com/zendframework2-for-beginners). It makes as much usage of the respective components of Zend Framework 2 as are required to support the book and the concepts which it attempts to teach. 

Lifting a bit out of the book, these areas are:

### Core Patterns (including):

- Factory
- MVC
- Observer/Subscriber
- Inversion of Control

### Core Concepts (including):

- ModuleManager
- EventsManager
- ServiceManager
- Dependency Injection
- Modules
- Routing
- Configuration
- Controllers & Actions
- Testing
- Deployment

### Additional Areas

- ZFTool
- External Modules
- Diagnostics

It's not aimed at people who are already proficient with Zend Framework 2, but those new to it, whether transitioning from Zend Framework 1, another framework or those getting in to using frameworks with PHP.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, simply clone it, then in the cloned project directory, run `vagrant up`. The project contains a Vagrant/Puppet virtual machine configuration, configured using [PuPHPet](http://www.puphpet.com). So there's no software to install, other than [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

## Bugs

If you find a bug in the code as always, let me know [by creating an issue](https://github.com/settermjd/zf2forbeginners/issues/). If there's a bug in the virtual machine, consider reporting an issue in [the PuPHPet issues tracker](https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet) or reviewing it to see if the issue's already been addressed.
